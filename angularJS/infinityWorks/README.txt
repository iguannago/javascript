This work is done as a SPA (Simple Page Application). 

Technology used: AngularJS and Jasmine for unit testing the code.  

Why? I weighed up different options such as Spring Boot and MVC approach or JSP and JSF. I really like the Spring boot and MVC option. If this project where a real one I would have choosen Spring because it is easier to maintain, extend and support. Finally, I opted with the AngularJS option because it was the quickest one.   

Improvements: 

There are plenty of improvemtns to be considered: 
1. Move this app to a Spring Boot and Java project to make it more enterprise. 
2. Increase the coverage of junit code. If it was a Spring - Java project it would be much easier to follow TDD. 
3. Definitely the getRatingPercentages method can be refactored to avoid the DRY principle. Again because of I did not have much time I opted for the easiest way, but not the clean one.
